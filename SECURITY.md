## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Primewave, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **[Your Email Address]**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues within 30 days, others within 90 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. **Credit**: We'll publicly credit you (if desired) after the fix is released

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Configured CORS policies
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables
- **HTTPS**: All production traffic over HTTPS
- **Database Security**: MongoDB Atlas with authentication

### Best Practices for Contributors

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## 🔍 Security Checklist for Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks in place
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and secure
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] CORS settings are appropriate

## 📋 Known Security Considerations

### Frontend
- Environment variables prefixed with `REACT_APP_` are public
- All client-side code is visible to users
- API keys should never be stored in frontend code

### Backend
- JWT secrets must be kept secure
- Database connection strings are sensitive
- Rate limiting should be implemented for APIs
- Input sanitization is crucial

### Deployment
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated
- Configure proper CORS policies
- Use secure headers

## 🚀 Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions
- Documented in release notes
- Communicated via GitHub Security Advisories
- Backwards compatible when possible
